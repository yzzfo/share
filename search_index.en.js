Lumen is a one-stop solution to stylized, performant volumetric lighting in stylized games.Features THREE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS of light that work together to dramatically stylize your game worlds:Do the lights in your scene feel lackluster? Do you want your audience to feel the warmth of the lights in your game? LUMEN LIGHT FLARES add a subtle halo to the lights in your scene providing an effect similar to that of volumetric point lights. This effect can be turned to the extreme as well filling your scenes with majestic glow and powerful auras—a must for any mystical item that your players may encounter!The LUMEN STATIC RAYS are a simple way to achieve any sort of volumetric ray. Godrays, sunshafts, spotlights, 2D, 3D, or anything in between, these rays do it all! Use these to add interest to your scene, direct the player's eye to important locations, fill the scene with moody lighting, or just make your scenes even prettier!Finally, LUMEN DYNAMIC RAYS use vertex colors and a custom shader to dynamically scale and contort the rays to a specific angle in real-time! Use these rays to track the sun dynamically, point rays at a moving target, or fake real-time volumetric lighting!WHY MESH-BASED EFFECTS?Built on a mesh-based, procedural material, Lumen throws out all of the calculations that most volumetric lighting solutions need by replacing the traditional mathematics with a simple vertex lit shader! This allows your effects to be calculated cheaply so that you can focus on the aesthetics of your scene, without worrying about the framerate decreasing. Beyond this, the lack of textures allows your disk space to be minimized without reducing the quality of the flares and rays that make your scene beautiful!Powerful tools to light your world:Scriptable object backend for quick and easy saving.A fully 3D mesh-based workflow means that effects can be infinitely scaled with no loss in quality!Dynamic and customizable depth fading that allows you to display and hide the light effects based on the depth of the scene.Advanced camera fading that fades light effects in and out based on the distance to the camera.Custom layering system for easy customization.Lightweight shader built-in with GPU instancing supportThe custom noise-based variation system smoothly interpolates light effects to a different color. Useful for everything from subtle, lazy light movement to sporadic, violent lighting.Global, local, and per-layer controls give you ultimate control over the way that you want the light to render in your scene.All shaders are built with Amplify Shader Editor for easy customization across Built-in and URP!Come prepared with out-of-the-box features:42 Premade light effects89 Light shapesTwo main shader typesFull inspector extensions built with quick and easy editing in mind from the startFully supports Built-In and URP for any platform!\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/battle-sound-library-magic-melee-fantasy-rpg/","title":"Battle Sound Library - Magic & Melee - Fantasy RPG","description":null,"body":"Hundreds of sound clips, and thousands upon thousands of mixes.

It's simulating real animal-like spine movement without any need of additional animating or coding.⌛ This component will make your animations look much more real and AAA like without spending a lot of timefor making decent animations of walking / running with rotation to sides by your creatures and without spending a lot of money for animator to create this animations.✍ Another benefit from this procedural animating is that all movement of bones is continuous, when your object is rotating, spine is fitting to movement all the time, so you can finally make your snakes, millipedes and other creatures animate like they're real!  What's more, when creature go up on the terrain/ground slope, body rotation will fit to it automatically!⚙ Don't worry about performance, you can run many Spine Animators simultaneously without loosing any FPS even on mobile!Package works on all SRPs!

It is a \"data\" element, usually persistent.Palette provider: an active element, living in a Unity scene, that acts as a broker between palettes and colorers, pushing color updates to any relevant colorers.Colorer: an active element that contains the logic to apply one or more colors to a scene component (UI elements, 3D models materials and more). A colorer must be connected to a palette provider, from which it retrieves colors for the color identifiers specified in its configuration.Ready to use Colorers for Unity components using color properties (UI elements, Materials etc) are included. That said, programmers can easily extend the system with additional custom colorers (and providers).You can improve your workflow with a new, more reasonable way to setup colors in Unity, with low friction and no compromises on your project organization.Anything can be done through the inspector if you want, but it's also easy to use the system through code only if you prefer.Palettes can be imported from commonly used third party formats and edited in the inspector, and in more advanced scenarios can be loaded at runtime from external files.The asset contents are laid out to be easily packaged for use in the Package Manager, if you want to easily import it (maybe including your own customizations) from multiple projects.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/runtime-editor/","title":"Runtime Editor","description":null,"body":"Runtime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs that help you create scene editor, game level editor, or your own modeling applicationRuntime Editor is a set of scripts and prefabs designed to help you create a scene editor, game level editor, or build your own modeling application.

Add battle-tested cross-platform input to your game. Rewired is input that works.Rewired is an advanced input system that completely redefines how you work with input, giving you an unprecedented level of control over one of the most important components of your game.Website | Documentation | Forum Thread |  Free TrialNative InputRewired is not just another Unity input wrapper like other packages. Rewired supports many platforms that Unity supports with extended native support on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, and Nintendo Switch. Rewired leverages native libraries to access input devices directly, allowing for far more control over input. This makes possible some very powerful features such as full hot-plugging support for joysticks, support for more than 20 buttons per controller, gamepad vibration, and more. Rewired is the only input system available for Unity with native support for all these platforms and the only to offer these advanced features. For other platforms, Rewired utilizes Unity's input system so you still get access to all the other features it provides.Player-CentricRewired features a player-centric input system making it the ideal solution for multi-player games. Controllers are intelligently auto-assigned to players on connect/disconnect, so you don't have to worry about what controllers each player owns. Access input by player instead of controller, so you always get the result you expect regardless of what controllers the player is using.Controller MapsRewired features a powerful controller mapping system that allows you to create highly complex input schemes for any style of game. Map supported controllers by logically named elements instead of cryptic Axis 0, etc. Maps stack so you can create different maps for different game modes and switch between them easily. Create default controller layouts for a variety of controllers and allow the player to customize his own mappings. Save and load maps via XML.Intelligent Hot-PluggingRewired solves all of Unity's hot plugging problems on Windows, OSX, Linux, Windows 10 Universal, WebGL, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, PS4, PS5, Switch, and Stadia. (All other supported platforms depend on Unity's hot-plugging support.) No more forcing your players to quit and restart when they change joysticks. No more guessing which controller is which. It just works.Input EditorEdit all your inputs from a powerful and easy to use editor. No coding just to add an action like some systems. Edit players, action and map categories, alternate map layouts, joystick, keyboard, mouse, and custom controller maps, input behaviors, and more from one convenient interface.Cross PlatformRewired takes the hassle out of cross-platform input. Supported controllers have been mapped for consistency on Windows, Windows 10 Universal, OSX, Linux, iOS, tvOS, Android, Amazon Fire TV, and Webplayers. Rewired also supports PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S/X, Switch, Stadia, PSM, WebGL, NVidia Shield, and other Android-based consoles.Supported ControllersRewired supports virtually any USB or Bluetooth controller via user mapping, and provides extended support for many common controllers of all types with more added all the time. Supported controllers are fully mapable by element name and have standardized axis directions.Control MapperRewired includes a complete, responsive, cross-platform runtime control remapping system. Simply add it to your project and configure it and your players can remap all their controls during the game! Highly configurable with built-in theme and language systems. Includes automatic or customized saving and loading of user data.Touch ControlsRewired comes with a set of customizable, on-screen Touch Controls suitable for mobile platforms and built using Unity UI.

Behavior Designer is dedicated to behavior trees, which means that each update will be a better behavior tree implementation.Documentation |  Videos | Samples | Discussions | Discord✔️Features:• An intuitive visual editor• A powerful API• Visual runtime debugger• Variables to communicate between tasks• Conditional Aborts• Built in event system• Use existing code with reflection tasks• Hundreds of tasks• Evaluate tasks using Utility Theory• Realtime error detection• Binary or JSON serialization• Data-oriented design• Zero runtime allocations after startup• Object drawers (property drawers)• Includes runtime source code• Extensive documentation and videos• Sample projects available online• Much more✔️Add-ons:• Behavior Designer for Malbers Animations• Behavior Designer for RPG Builder• Deathmatch AI Kit• Formations Pack• Movement Pack• Tactical Pack✔️Integrations:• 2D Toolkit• A* Pathfinding Project (Movement Pack)• Adventure Creator• Anti-Cheat Toolkit• Blox• Bolt (Visual Scripting)• Camera Path Animator• Cinema Director• Control Freak• Core GameKit• Curvy• Dialogue System• DOTween• Final IK• Inventory Pro• LeanTween• Love/Hate• Master Audio• Mirror• NGUI• Particle Playground• PlayMaker• PolyNav (Movement Pack)• Pool Boss• PoolManager• Pool, Trigger, Constrain Bundle• Quest Machine• Rewired• Sensor Toolkit• Simple Waypoint System• Ultimate Character Controller• Ultimate Inventory System• uScript• uSequencer• Visual Scripting* Some promo screenshots contain tasks from the Movement Pack or third party integrations.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/animancer-pro/","title":"Animancer Pro","description":null,"body":"[Pro] [Lite] [Documentation] [Samples] [Help and FAQ]The minimum supported version of Unity is 2022.3. Please check the Upgrade Guide if you're using an older version of Unity or upgrading from an older version of Animancer.Animancer allows you to play animations on-demand and control all their details without any additional setup steps. It solves the major problems with Animator Controllers and can either replace them entirely or work alongside them. This makes animations much easier to work with in all stages of development from basic prototyping through to maintaining and debugging complex systems.You can try out all the Features for FREE with Animancer Lite then seamlessly upgrade to Animancer Pro if needed.It has plenty of detailed Samples to get you started,an extensive User Manual that explains how everything works,and even an introduction to C# in Unity in case you are new to programming. The Platformer Game Kit demonstrates how Animancer can be used in a more complex environment.Features:❶ Quick Play -&gt;Play animations on-demand without any unnecessary setup steps. Just get an AnimationClip and call animancer.Play(clip).❷ Easy Waiting -&gt;Register an End Event or yield return an AnimancerState inside a Coroutine to wait for an animation to finish.❸ Smooth Transitions -&gt;Blend between animations over time linearly or using a Custom Curve to ensure that your characters always move smoothly.❹ Flexible Structure -&gt;Organise your animations using data structures like arrays and Scriptable Objects and avoid Magic Strings.❺ Live Inspector -&gt;View the current details of your animations in the Inspector with manual controls for debugging and testing.❻ Finite State Machines -&gt;Animancer comes with a flexible FSM system which is entirely separate from the animation system. They work well together, but you can very easily modify it or use any other system you prefer.❼ High Performance -&gt;Animancer can be more efficient than other systems, though in most cases the differences are small enough not to matter either way.❽ Smooth Integration -&gt;Most plugins developed for other animation systems should work out of the box with Animancer and it supports features likeHumanoid Animation Retargeting,Generic Rigs,Sprite animations,Root Motion,Animation Events, andInverse Kinematics (IK).Animancer Pro Features: you can try out the following features for FREE in the Unity Editor with Animancer Lite, but you will need to purchase Animancer Pro to use them in a runtime build or access the Source Code.❶ Total Control -&gt;You have full access to and control over all animation details in runtime scripts, including their speed, time, and blend weight.❷ Simple Configuration -&gt;Manage the details of your animations in the Inspector so they can be edited as part of a scene or prefab.❸ Custom Events -&gt;Register Event callbacks to be triggered at specific times during an animation without the hassle of Unity's regular Animation Events.❹ Animation Layers -&gt;Manage multiple animation sets at the same time (generally on different body parts). Layers can either override or add to each other and you can fade them in and out just like individual animations.❺ Animator Controllers -&gt;Animancer does not require the use of Animator Controllers, but it does support a Hybrid approach which uses them alongside direct AnimationClip references for different tasks. You can even mix multiple Animator Controllers on a single character.❻ Animation Mixers -&gt;Blend between animations based on any input parameter much like Blend Trees. For example, you could blend between Idle, Walk, and Run based on how far the player tilts a joystick to allow them to move at any speed.❼ Tools -&gt;Various utilities for creating and modifying animations which can then be played with Animancer or any other animation system that supports them. These tools allow you to work with Sprites and Sprite based animations in bulk, such as renaming multiple Sprites at once or generating animations from them based on their names. ❽ Customisation -&gt;Use Unity's Animation Job system for low level access to the animation stream and create Custom State types to implement procedural animation, custom blending algorithms, or any other behaviour you can think of.❾ Source Code -&gt;The full source code of Animancer is included as plain C# files with detailed comments so you can see all its internal workings, track down bugs, make any modifications you see fit, and avoid becoming dependant on the developer to fix issues (but feel free to use the Help and FAQ page if you need support). The Animancer.Lite.dll included in the Animancer Pro package are empty dummies to ensure seamless upgrades from Animancer Lite, so they contain no code and are not included in builds.Check out the Documentation and Samples to get started.Note that the Samples use various third party art assets under the CC0 license.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://yzzfo.github.io/en/unity/store/a-pathfinding-project-pro/","title":"A* Pathfinding Project Pro","description":null,"body":"The A* Pathfinding Project is a powerful and easy to use pathfinding system for Unity. With blazing fast pathfinding your AIs will be able to find the player in complex mazes in no time at all.Whether you write an RPG, FPS, RTS or TD game, this package is for you. With heavily optimized algorithms and a large, yet simple to use, feature set, you will quickly be able to make those bots a bit smarter.FeaturesSupports grid, navmesh, point and hexagonal graphs.Automatic navmesh generation, to save you from doing it manually.High performance and fully multithreaded, so it will barely affect the frame rate.Smooth agent movement.A single line of code to make a pathfinding request.Graphs can be saved to files.Supports both 2D and 3D games.Local Avoidance.Source code included.Supports updating graphs during runtime.Uses the Burst compiler, Unity Job System, and (optionally) ECS under the hood, for maximum performance.Allows tagging nodes to make different agents treat them in different ways.And so much more.Demos and videosMore info here!Extensive documentationIncludes a total of 16 example scenes to help you get started.A comprehensive online documentation with tutorials, and in which almost all functions and fields are documented.\n","path":null}]
